- Simulate appearance of LCD screen
- Game sound and clock
- Inspired by [react-tetris](https://github.com/chvin/react-tetris/blob/master/README-EN.md)

#### Game Rules：

- 100 points for 1 line, 300 points for 2 lines, 700 points for 3 lines, 1500 points for 4 lines;
- The drop speed of the box increases with the number of rows eliminated (one level for every 20
  lines);
